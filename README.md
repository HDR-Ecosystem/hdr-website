# HDR Ecosystem Website

This repository contains the code for the HDR (Harnessing the Data Revolution) Ecosystem website.

The Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Community is a national ecosystem of NSF-funded institutes advancing data-intensive science, engineering, and education through convergence research. Established under the NSF Big Idea Harnessing the Data Revolution, the HDR Community brings together domain scientists, data scientists, and cyberinfrastructure experts to accelerate discovery, develop scalable and interoperable tools, and prepare a diverse data-enabled workforce.

Member institutes—including [A3D3](https://a3d3.ai/), [Imageomics](https://imageomics.org), [ID4](https://id4.mines.edu/), [iHARP](https://iharp.umbc.edu/), and [I-GUIDE](https://i-guide.io/)—serve as both independent centers of excellence and collaborative partners, addressing challenges ranging from climate resilience and polar research to biology, materials design, and artificial intelligence. Through shared resources, cross-institute initiatives, and open science practices, the HDR Community strengthens the national research enterprise and ensures that data-driven innovation contributes to scientific progress and societal well-being.
