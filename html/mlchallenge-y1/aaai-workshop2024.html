                        University of California, Irvine. Eric has also held research positions at DeepMind, Microsoft,

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Anomaly detectors perform essential tasks ranging from protecting an autonomous
                        system from abnormal inputs to isolating interesting scientific signals that may lead to
                        discovery. However, how do we know that the anomaly detector will be robust? The detector itself
                        could be susceptible to failure if there is a change in the distribution of anomalies expected.
                        And to make matters worse, we usually don't have an abundance of test-time anomalies that are
                        labeled as such. In this talk, I will discuss my group's recent work on monitoring if our
                        anomaly detector is still valid and adapting it to data shift, without supervision.</p>

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which determines whether a given sample is
                        part of the in-distribution (ID), has
                        recently shown promising results through training with synthetic OOD datasets. Nonetheless,
                        existing methods often
                        produce outliers that are considerably distant from the ID, showing limited efficacy for
                        capturing subtle distinctions
                        between ID and OOD. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Semantic Outlier
                        generation via Nuisance
                        Awareness (SONA), which notably produces challenging outliers by directly leveraging pixel-space
                        ID samples through
                        diffusion models. Our approach incorporates SONA guidance, providing separate control over
                        semantic and nuisance regions
                        of ID samples. Thereby, the generated outliers achieve two crucial properties: (i) they present
                        explicit
                        semantic-discrepant information, while (ii) maintaining various levels of nuisance resemblance
                        with ID. Furthermore, the
                        improved OOD detector training with SONA outliers facilitates learning with a focus on semantic
                        distinctions. Extensive
                        experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving an impressive AUROC of 88%
                        on near-OOD datasets,
                        surpassing the performance of baseline methods by a significant margin of approximately 6%.</p>

            <h2>Topics</h2>
            <p>
                We encourage participation from researchers in a broad range of topics that explore AI/ML techniques to
                detect novel patterns and anomalies within data and promote scientific discovery. Examples of research
                questions include (but are not limited to):
            <ol>
                <li>How can we automate the discovery of new scientific phenomena?</li>
                <li>How can we embed a notion of uncertainty within AI/ML to quantify the significance of a discovery?
                </li>
                <li>How do we ensure FAIR reproducibility of these discoveries?</li>
                <li>What interpretable AI/ML approaches can lead to direct explanations of these discoveries?</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>Key Dates</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Paper Submission Deadline: December 6, 2024. 11:59 PM AOE</li>
                <li>Acceptance/Rejection Decision: December 16, 2024</li>
                <li>Early Registration Deadline: December 19, 2024. 11:59 PM AOE</li>
                <li>Camera-Ready Deadline: February 15, 2025, 11:59 PM AOE</li>
                <li>Poster Deadline: February 20, 2025, 11:59 PM AOE</li>
                <li>Workshop Date: March 4, 2025</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <small>We offer an extended deadline for submissions with the same Camera-Ready and Poster Deadlines,
                    but keep in mind that these are <i><b>after</b></i> the AAAI Early Registration Deadline has
                    passed.</small>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paper Submission Deadline: January 31, 2025. 11:59 PM AOE</li>
                <li>Acceptance/Rejection Decision: February 7, 2025</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                We are accepting extended abstract submissions for position, review, or research results (up to 2 pages,
                excluding references). Shorter versions (up to 6 pages, excluding references) of articles in submission
                or accepted at other venues (or presented after Oct. 1, 2024) are acceptable as long as they do not
                violate the dual-submission policy of the other venue. We allow the addition of an appendix (no page
                limit) following references. All submissions will undergo peer review (double-blind).
            </p>
            <p>
                Submissions should follow the AAAI template format (two-column, camera-ready style; <a
                    href="https://aaai.org/authorkit25/" target="_blank">AAAI Author Kit</a>) and submitted via CMT.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>The accepted paper will <b>NOT</b> be archived in AAAI proceedings. This allows the authors to extend
                    their work afterward and submit it to a conference or journal.</i>
